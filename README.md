Common Libraries used for Web Applications. They are designed specially
for Java applications built around the Spring Framework that are pure
REST services for doing web 2.0 style applications. It is possible to
take advantage of many features for non-web services based applications
but the primary focus and design of everything is around enabling the
quick, clean, and consistent development of restful web services with a
consistent downstream experience for the actual UI implementers as well
as SOA architecture systems integrating with these services.
